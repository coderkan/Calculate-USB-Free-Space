This program can be running Linux OS.
This program compiled Linux gcc.

Shortly the program is calculate and show you inserted USB device free memory.
I used statfs function to examine it.

To compile : gcc -o main main.c
To run     : ./main ..usb device path.. //like /media/USBDEVICE

Have a nice coding...
